The goal of this project was to interface a 3.5 inch floppy disc drive with the Altera DE2 FPGA in order to play a song composed of musical tones played at different frequencies. The tones were produced by controlling the stepper motor contained in the floppy drive. This was accomplished by controlling several pins on the floppy driveâ€™s IDE cable. Of the 34 pins available, 5 pins were used in this project to control the floppy drive (density select, motor enable, drive select, stepper motor direction, head step).
